**Automate the boring stuff with Python.**

A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type. The most common data types are:

1. _Integers,_
2. _Floating-point numbers, and_
3. _Strings._

## Variables Names

1. One word
2. Letters, numbers and the underscore
3. Can't begin with a number

## For Loops

1. The for keyword
2. A variable name
3. The in keyword
4. A call to the range() method with up to three integers passed to it
5. A colon
6. Starting on the next line, an indented block of code(the _for_ clause.)
